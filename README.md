## Description
- Dataset used for the development of a system that detects, tracks, and counts different types of vehicles, as well as pedestrians, at selected street intersections in these cities.  
- Labeling done in Yolo Label.
- One label file per image. Follows YOLO formatting with normalized measurements (id, x_center, y_center, width, height).
