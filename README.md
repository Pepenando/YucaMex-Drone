# YucaMex-Drone

Dataset of images and object detection annotation labels taken by a drone from different intersections in the cities of Valladolid and Uman in Yucatan, Mexico. 

## Description
- Dataset used for the development of a system that detects, tracks, and counts different types of vehicles, as well as pedestrians, at study intersections in these cities.  
- Labeling done in Yolo Label.
- One label file per image. Follows YOLO formatting with normalized measurements (id, x_center, y_center, width, height).

Object types (from left to right see image):
- Top: car, truck, bus, combi. 
- Bottom: motorcycle, bike, mototaxi, pedestrian.
